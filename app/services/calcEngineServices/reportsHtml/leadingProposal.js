describe_problem_area: 'U.S. government reports describe the effects of tax evasion
in terms of lost revenue. On the federal level, lost revenue from intentional evasion
and unintentional errors comes to about $458 billion per year — $406 billion after
the IRS pursues late payments and enforcement actions, according to a 2019 report
from the Government Accountability Office. That report relies on data from the IRS
covering 2008 to 2010, and it provides the most recent estimate of yearly federal
revenue lost due to individual and corporate tax evasion.


Total taxable annual income is about $2.5 trillion, according to that report, and
the $406 billion is what the IRS calls the “net tax gap.” How does the tax gap stack
up to other items on the government ledger? It’s a couple drops in the bucket compared
to the $23 trillion in total public debt. But it’s also 37% of the $1.1 trillion
Department of Defense budget for 2019 and is far more than the annual budget for
just about every other government agency.

reasoning: "1) Are credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations\
\ are doing unethical tax evasion (by any term)?:\n  And those companies and executives\
\ were never convicted of tax evasion related crimes?{You the citizen will vote}\n\
2) If a US citizen (commoner) works in the USA, lives in the USA but had their paycheck\
\ deposited into their off-shore bank.  \n  If they then never paid taxes, they\
\ would be put in jail.  If US companies do the same (put their profits or revenue\
\ offshore) when they are a USA company or the revenue was generated in the USA,\
\ does the government chage them with a crime? \n  And convict them? If not, then\
\ the government sells out.  {Needs research and debate}\n3) Do you consider it\
\ THEFT if corporations do tax evasion by moving profits offshore and not paying\
\ taxes? (Especially if citizens are put in jail if they did it with their salarys)\n\
4) Does the USA put commoners in jail when they do tax evasion: {Needs research\
\ and debate}\n5) Are  credible sources / articles / books claiming that corporations\
\ carry out tricks to move profits or revenue to offshore entities for the purpose\
\ of tax evasion? \n6) Do you consider it a crime of THEFT if corporations carry\
\ out tricks to do tax evasion (or instead something you consider on unethically\
\ not paying taxes)? Especially if a USA worker would\n  go to jail if they did\
\ the same with not paying taxes on their salary?\n7) If a USA worker lived in the\
\ US, worked in the US, but had a bank account in Irland.  If they had their employer\
\ auto-deposite their paycheck to their Iriland bank, they would be put in jail\
\ for tax exavsion when they didn't pay taxes. Ethically, this is the tax evasion\
\ corporations carry out (after looking past their excuses). The decision for the\
\ voter is it theft then corporations do the kind of tax behavior that would send\
\ a USA worker to jail if they did it.\n8) USA workers/citizens pay 88.9% of US\
\ Gov taxes.  All corporations and businesses only pay 7.2%.  This is even worse\
\ when large corporations are the one that can do tax evasions so the businesses\
\ that pay taxes are small businesses. These are in 2018 numbers. Source: https://usafacts.org/data/topics/government-finances/revenue/\n\
\  USA Total revenue/taxes are $4,873 billion (2018).  Corp income taxes are $349\
\ billion (7.2%).\n  US Workers pay 88.9% or $4,334 billion from: a) Income tax,\
\ b) sales tax, c) Property tax and d) Payroll taxes.\n  In 1920, corporations paid\
\ most taxes. This has been shifted to citizens by a sell out government.\n9) Do\
\ USA corporation use subsideary companies in other countries to push their profits\
\ overseas so they don't pay zero (or far less) taxes in the USA?\n10) Do USA corporation\
\ use subsideary companies, and then have their profits from prior year staying\
\ in other countries for later years because they do NOT want to bring it back into\
\ the USA (because they probably want to avoid taxes)?   \n  \n"
reasoning_on_size_of_problem:
- reasoning: "We find the best number, between these three numbers:\nA. When US Workers\
\ pay 88.9% of US Gov Taxes/Revenues. Compared to all businesses\n   at 7.2% (in\
\ 2018). What amount should corporations pay, if the tax\n   burden SHOULD BE\
\ shifted from US workers to corporations. What percent\n   of the $4,873 billion\
\ (2018) US Gov tax revenues should come from businesses?\nB. Find the quote for\
\ the amount of tax evasion by corporations\n   from articles.\nC. Find the profits\
\ across all publicly traded companies.\n   Find the amount of tax paid by those\
\ publicly traded companies.\n   Find the amount of tax citizens estimate should\
\ be paid on profits\n   (n%).  Compare how much was really paid vs the percent\
\ from\n   profits.\nD. Find the revenue from all publicly traded USA companies.\n\
\   Find a percentage of their revenue that should be taxed\n   and find that\
\ number.  Compare that to the amount of taxes collected.\n"

key_findings_from_the_above_report: 'At least 366 companies, or 73 percent
 of the Fortune 500, operate one or more subsidiaries in tax haven countries.


 These 366 companies collectively maintain at least 9,755 tax haven subsidiaries.
 The 30 companies with the most money officially booked offshore for tax
 purposes collectively operate 2,213 tax haven subsidiaries.


 Four companies (Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and General Electric) account for
 25 percent of Fortune 500 companies'' offshore cash.


 Thirty Fortune 500 companies account for 68 percent, or $1.76 trillion,
 of these offshore profits.


 About 57 percent of companies with tax haven subsidiaries have set up at
 least one in Bermuda or the Cayman Islands — two particularly notorious
 tax havens. The profits that all American multinationals — not just Fortune
 500 companies —implausibly claimed they earned in these two island nations
 according to the most recent data totaled 1,884 percent and 1,313 percent
 of each country’s entire yearly economic output, respectively.


 Only 58 Fortune 500 companies disclose what they would expect to pay in
 U.S. taxes if their profits were not officially booked offshore. In total,
 these 58 companies would owe $240 billion in additional federal taxes. The
 average tax rate the 58 companies currently pay to other countries on this
 income is a mere 6.1 percent, implying that most of it is booked to tax
 havens.
